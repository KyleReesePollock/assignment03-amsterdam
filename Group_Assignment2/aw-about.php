I'm a Junior, but I graduate in December 2018. Currently freaking out about graduating so soon. I originally was a Neuroscience and math double major on the Pre-Med track. I decided I hated being stuck in a lab freshman year. So, I experimented with different classes and figured out I love journalism and law. I am now an English: Language, Media, and Communications major with a Legal Studies minor (AKA Pre-Law). I am very shy, but very outgoing. It is a weird combination. I think I am one of those extroverted introverts. I LOVE hugs. My grandpa called me a koala because I would always be hugging/hanging off someone as a child. I have learned my boundaries since (after being punched in the face), so I refuse to hug people unless they initiate it.

I love photography and art, but I am very shy about sharing them. I have designed several merchandises for clubs the past 3 years. My advisor gets upset because I refuse to put my signature on them. I just prefer to internally shriek with happiness when I see my designs on people's laptops or around campus. I have hearing issues, so I sometimes have look at people's lips to make sure I am hearing things correctly. It has made for some very awkward moments…

Random Facts: I am a pacifist and will avoid conflict like the plague. I don't get angry very often, contrary to the redhead stereotype. Friends call me Ber. I cannot smell vanilla. I hate technology, and technology hates me. I don’t really know why I’m in this class. Finally….I. Love. Coffee. So. Much. It. Is. Unhealthy.

I've lived most of my life in a very small, conservative Texas town, but the farthest north I ever got before UR was Missouri. Since being in college, I've learn that Texas is probably the weirdest state to exist. For instance, Texans don't have a southern accent. We have a distinct twang. We cut off the endings of words, nearly every vowel sounds the same, sentence context is very important since a lot of words sound similar. Evidently no one outside of Texas sayings "flying by the seat of your pants" and "lower than a snake's belly in a wagon rut". Fortunately, my accent is only prominent when I'm angry or tired; however, I still silence a room with my exclamations.

In my town, Cotillion is this weird necessity in order to be considered an adult. But, it's by far the most ridiculous thing I have participated in in my entire life. I was a student for 3 years; then taught dance for 4 years. We always had more girls than we did boys, so I supplemented during most classes. Because of this, I don't remember how to be lead. Some of the dumbest things I learned: There's a proper way to squeeze a lemon. Only women wear gloves. Women are to stand behind and halfway covered by their escort when not on their arm. Women cannot get their own refreshments. If you clink your spoon against your glass when mixing lemon in it or whatever, you're an "uncultured swine."

I've worked as a Digital Associate the past year for a small national student publication called The Rival. I'm the only design artist, so I design all the content weeks, advertisement and marketing strategy, and the publishing efforts. Aka I'm the only one who can yell at the boss for sending corrupted files. We're currently going through a website transfer. I'm assisting in the design aspect, but I refuse to touch anything else. 
The Rival is small and centralized to mostly the east coast, but we have 13 universities such as GW, American, Tulane, Fordham, and C of C. There's even a Rival here at UR! One of our writers, who is now Director of Communications, actually broke the story regarding Eastman's housing crisis. Unfortunately, The Rival Rochester is phasing out since there's limited student interest in another student publication platform.

This is by far my favorite photo I have ever taken. I love capturing simple yet tender moments. It's even better if it's not planned. It also incorporates my first love, the city. I captured it during spring break last year with my brother. It was his first time there, so I was showing him around. We went to Top of the Rock, and it was so cold I thought I lost my face to frostbite. It was worth it for this photo though.
