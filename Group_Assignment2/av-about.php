            <p>I currently work as a student assistant at the chemistry department. I have held this job for a little over a year now. My job entails maintaining the department website, organizing student information and designing brochures, posters and flyers for chemistry events. At the university I am involved in several organizations including Womens Leadership Alliance, Students Helping Honduras, Society of Women Engineers.In Womens Leadership Alliance I am currently in business manager, the organization strives to empower women in the university and Rochester community. I have been a part of Students Helping Honduras for three years now. This organization strives to alleviate gang violence and poverty in areas of Honduras with the help of education. We raise funds and go every spring break to Honduras to help build schools. Regarding my classes I am currently taking ME 241 Fluids Lab, ME 251 Heat Power and ME 223 Heat Transfer, this computer science course and MTH 150 Discrete Mathematics. I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in computer science. After graduation I hope to go to graduate school, where I hope to receive a degree in engineering management with a concentration in computer science.</p>

            <p>I hope to work with the design and manufacturing of parts in the automotive industry. However, though I am interested in going into industry I also have a strong interest in the business aspects that surround engineering. I have not made a definitive decision on whether I want to attend grad school after undergraduate school, but I feel that it is important to keep my options open. Especially since I want to eventually work in the business of engineering, I feel that there are a lot of grad programs that combine business and engineering well.</p>
            
            <p>I have researched different schools and programs that I found interesting. I am not sure whether I want to stay in Rochester after graduation but I have looked into the masters program, Master of Science in Technical Entrepreneurship and Management here at the University of Rochester. The program differs from the Engineering Management Program at Duke University in that the program at the University of Rochester has a heavier concentration on starting your own business.</p>
             
             <p>I have not decided where I want to study, but am leaning towards returning home. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, a city with a population of over a million people. I attended the first public all girl school of Texas, Irma Lerma Rangel Young Womens Leadership School. I attended this school from grades sixth to twelfth. Here I graduated with my class of 59 other students. While in high school I played multiple sports at my home school, Samuell High School. I played at my home school because my school did not offer many sports. I was in volleyball and swimming for three years and soccer for one year. In Dallas I lived with my mom and sister in a three bedroom house. I also have two pets a dog and a bird. My dogs name is Tiny and my birds name is Limoncello. I have had both my pets for a little over a year. I am 20 years old and will be turning 21 in February of this year. My favorite colors are blue and black. This is now my third year at the university and I reside in Anderson. Although I am from Dallas, Texas my family is from Ecuador and Mexico. My dad was born and raised in Mexico, specifically Durango. While my mom was born in New Jersey but raised in Quito, Ecuador. I have vistied Toronto,Canada.</p>

            <p>For my free time I like to spend time watching shows and reading. Currently I am watching the Grey’s Anatomy, a show about the main character Meredith Grey who works in a hospital in Seattle, Washington. The show is about the people who work in the hospital and what they go through in and outside the hospital. As for reading my favorite book is Catcher in the Rye. The book is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. It is about the main character Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern California near Hollywood in 1951. Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B, an author and World War II veteran whom Holden resents for becoming a screenwriter, after his release in one month. As he waits, Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas. My favorite poem is Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe:</p>
            
            <p>It was many and many a year ago, <br/>
               In a kingdom by the sea, <br/>
            That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br/>
               By the name of Annabel Lee; <br/>
            And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br/>
               Than to love and be loved by me. </p>
            
            <p>I was a child and she was a child, <br/>
               In this kingdom by the sea, <br/>
            But we loved with a love that was more than love— <br/>
               I and my Annabel Lee— <br/>
            With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven <br/>
               Coveted her and me. </p>
            
            <p>And this was the reason that, long ago, <br/>
               In this kingdom by the sea, <br/>
            A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br/>
               My beautiful Annabel Lee; <br/>
            So that her highborn kinsmen came <br/>
               And bore her away from me, <br/>
            To shut her up in a sepulchre <br/>
               In this kingdom by the sea. </p>
            
           <p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, <br/>
               Went envying her and me— <br/>
            Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, <br/>
               In this kingdom by the sea) <br/>
            That the wind came out of the cloud by night, <br/>
               Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. </p>
            
            <p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br/>
               Of those who were older than we— <br/>
               Of many far wiser than we— <br/>
            And neither the angels in Heaven above <br/>
               Nor the demons down under the sea <br/>
            Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br/>
               Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </p>
            
            <p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br/> 
               Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br/>
            And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes <br/>
               Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br/>
            And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side <br/>
               Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, <br/>
               In her sepulchre there by the sea— <br/>
               In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
