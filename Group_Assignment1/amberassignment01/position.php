<h1> Position - Design Artist </h1>

<p>
I've worked as a Digital Associate the past year for a small national student publication called The Rival. I'm the only design artist, so I design all the content weeks, advertisement and marketing strategy, the actual advertisments, and the publishing efforts. Basically, I'm the only one who can yell at the boss for sending corrupted files. We're currently going through a website transfer which I'm assiting with the design aspect.
</p>

<p>
The Rival is small and centralized to mostly the east coast, but we have 13 universities such as GW, American, Tulane, Fordham, and C of C. There's even a Rival here at UR! One of our writers, who is now Director of Communications, actually broke the story regarding Eastman's housing crisis. Unfortunately, The Rival Rochester is phasing out since there's limited student interest in another student publication platform outside of Campus times.

<p>
This is why I chose Design Artist as my first role. It’s a safer choice for me since I have experience designing. I don't have much experience designing a web-page with CSS, but I figured since I have the design chops, the coding chops can be learned as I go. I’ve very rusty with code and lingo since I took 170 about a year ago. I have all my notes, so I should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully...
