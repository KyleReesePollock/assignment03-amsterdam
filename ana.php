            <p>For my free time I like to spend time watching shows and reading. Currently I am watching the Greyâ€™s Anatomy,
                a show about the main character Meredith Grey who works in a hospital in Seattle, Washington. The show is
                about the people who work in the hospital and what they go through in and outside the hospital. As for reading
                my favorite book is Catcher in the Rye. The book is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. It is about the main
                character Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern
                California near Hollywood in 1951. Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B, an author and World War
                II veteran whom Holden resents for becoming a screenwriter, after his release in one month. As he waits,
                Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas. My favorite poem is Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe:</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>

            <p>I have researched different schools and programs that I found interesting. I am not sure whether I want to stay
                in Rochester after graduation but I have looked into the masters program, Master of Science in Technical
                Entrepreneurship and Management here at the University of Rochester. The program differs from the Engineering
                Management Program at Duke University in that the program at the University of Rochester has a heavier concentration
                on starting your own business.</p>

            <p>I have not decided where I want to study, but am leaning towards returning home. I was born and raised in Dallas,
                Texas, a city with a population of over a million people. I attended the first public all girl school of
                Texas, Irma Lerma Rangel Young Womens Leadership School. I attended this school from grades sixth to twelfth.
                Here I graduated with my class of 59 other students. While in high school I played multiple sports at my
                home school, Samuell High School. I played at my home school because my school did not offer many sports.
                I was in volleyball and swimming for three years and soccer for one year. In Dallas I lived with my mom and
                sister in a three bedroom house. I also have two pets a dog and a bird. My dogs name is Tiny and my birds
                name is Limoncello. I have had both my pets for a little over a year. I am 20 years old and will be turning
                21 in February of this year. My favorite colors are blue and black. This is now my third year at the university
                and I reside in Anderson. Although I am from Dallas, Texas my family is from Ecuador and Mexico. My dad was
                born and raised in Mexico, specifically Durango. While my mom was born in New Jersey but raised in Quito,
                Ecuador. I have vistied Toronto,Canada.</p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>

            <p>I currently work as a student assistant at the chemistry department. I have held this job for a little over a
                year now. My job entails maintaining the department website, organizing student information and designing
                brochures, posters and flyers for chemistry events. At the university I am involved in several organizations
                including Womens Leadership Alliance, Students Helping Honduras, Society of Women Engineers.In Womens Leadership
                Alliance I am currently in business manager, the organization strives to empower women in the university
                and Rochester community. I have been a part of Students Helping Honduras for three years now. This organization
                strives to alleviate gang violence and poverty in areas of Honduras with the help of education. We raise
                funds and go every spring break to Honduras to help build schools. Regarding my classes I am currently taking
                ME 241 Fluids Lab, ME 251 Heat Power and ME 223 Heat Transfer, this computer science course and MTH 150 Discrete
                Mathematics. I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in computer science. After graduation
                I hope to go to graduate school, where I hope to receive a degree in engineering management with a concentration
                in computer science.</p>

            <p>I hope to work with the design and manufacturing of parts in the automotive industry. However, though I am interested
                in going into industry I also have a strong interest in the business aspects that surround engineering. I
                have not made a definitive decision on whether I want to attend grad school after undergraduate school, but
                I feel that it is important to keep my options open. Especially since I want to eventually work in the business
                of engineering, I feel that there are a lot of grad programs that combine business and engineering well.</p>
