In my opinion, the three most delicious and versatile **vegetables** in the world are Zucchini, Cauliflower, and Carrots. All three can be made into the delicious base of a nice vegan meal. Zucchini makes a healthy and tasty pasta substitute when spiralized. Cauliflower can be shredded with a food processor into a substitute for white rice. And carrots can be crinkle cut and baked into healthy french fries. In this way, all of these vegetables are healthy but disguise themselves as carbs, allowing people to satisfy their need for junk food while still getting veggies. And that's a beautiful thing.

###Zucchini

####History

Zucchini, like all [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(plant)), has its ancestry in the Americas. However, the varieties of green, cylindrical squash harvested immature and typically called "zucchini" were developed in northern Italy, long after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas. It appears that this occurred in the second half of the 19th century, though the first description of the variety under the name *zucchini* occurs in a work published in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan) in 1901;[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-8) early varieties usually appended the names of nearby cities in their names.

The word *zucchini* and this culinary variety of *C. pepo* arose independently and simultaneously in 19th-century Tuscany and northern Italy.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-9) *Zucca* is the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language) word for pumpkin/squash and *zucchino*/*zucchina* (*zucca* + *ina* = little) are diminutive forms, becoming *zucchini*/*zucchine* in the plural. *Zucchino*, the masculine form (*zucchini* in the plural), is the first form to be documented in writing.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-crusca-3) An Italian dictionary called *lo Zingarelli 2015, Zanichelli Editore*, gives both forms, as does the *Devoto-Oli*published by Le Monnier, but the [Accademia della Crusca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_della_Crusca), the most important research institution on Italian language, defines *zucchino* as the preferable form.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-crusca-3) The Treccani, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana, another highly respected linguistic authority, gives *zucchina* as the main Italian word, and the masculine form as Tuscan dialect. *Zucchini* is used in Italy, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United States. Zucchini is one of the plural forms in English (along with zucchinis), as well as the singular form.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-webster-10)

####Culinary Uses

When used for food, zucchini are usually picked when under 20 cm (8 in) in length, when the [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) are still soft and immature. Mature zucchini can be a metre long or more. The larger ones are often fibrous. A zucchini with the flowers attached is a sign of a truly fresh and immature fruit, and it is especially sought after for its sweeter flavor.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-oneill-12)

Unlike [cucumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber), zucchini is usually served cooked. It can be prepared using a variety of cooking techniques, including steamed, boiled, grilled, [stuffed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_zucchini) and baked, barbecued, fried, or incorporated in other recipes such as *soufflés*. Zucchini can also be baked into a bread[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini#cite_note-13) similar to [banana bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_bread) or incorporated into a cake mix. Its [flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower) can be eaten stuffed and are a delicacy when deep fried, as *tempura*.


###Cauliflower

####History

In the 1st century AD, [Pliny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) included what he called *cyma* among his descriptions of cultivated plants in *Natural History*: "*Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma,*"[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-3) ("Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is *cyma*").[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-4) Pliny's descriptions likely refer to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of *Brassica oleracea*, but comes close to describing modern cauliflower.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-5) It is found in the writings of the Arab botanists [Ibn al-'Awwam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-%27Awwam) and [Ibn al-Baitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Baitar), in the 12th and 13th centuries when its origins were said to be Cyprus.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-AggieHorticulture-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-7)

[François Pierre La Varenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Pierre_La_Varenne) employed *chouxfleurs* in *Le cuisinier françois*.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-8) They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century, and are featured in [Olivier de Serres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_de_Serres)' *Théâtre de l'agriculture*(1600), as *cauli-fiori* "as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy",[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-9) but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France).[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-10) It was introduced in India in 1822 from England by the British.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-11)

#### Production

In 2014, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with [broccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli)) was 24.2 million [tonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne), an 8% increase over 2013 world production.[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-fao14-18) China and India together accounted for 74% of the total (table).[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-fao14-18) Secondary producers, having 0.5–1.2 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico and Italy.[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower#cite_note-fao14-18)

###Carrot

#### History

Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Iorizzo-4) Its wild ancestors probably originated in [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Persia) (regions of which are now [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran) and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan)), which remains the centre of diversity for the [wild carrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_carrot) *Daucus carota*. A naturally occurring [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) of the wild carrot was presumably [bred selectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding) over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Rose_2006-5)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Mabey_1997-6)

When they were first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds have been found in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) and [Southern Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Germany) dating back to 2000–3000 BC.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-8) Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as [parsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley), [cilantro, coriander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander), [fennel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennel), anise, [dill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dill) and [cumin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin). The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Simon_p._328-9); the Romans ate a root vegetable called *pastinaca*,[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-10) which may have been either the carrot or the closely related [parsnip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsnip).[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-11)[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-12)

The plant is depicted and described in the [Eastern Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman)[Juliana Anicia Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Anicia_Codex), a 6th-century AD [Constantinopolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople) copy of the Greek physician [Dioscorides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorides)' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, [De Materia Medica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Materia_Medica). Three different types of carrots are depicted, and the text states that "the root can be cooked and eaten".[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-13)

#####Origin

The plant was introduced into Spain by the [Moors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors)in the 8th century.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Krech_2004-14) In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Purple-15) The modern carrot originated in [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan) at about this time.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Simon_p._328-9) The 11th-century Jewish scholar [Simeon Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Seth) describes both red and yellow carrots,[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Dalby_2003-16) as does the 12th-century Arab-[Andalusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_people) agriculturist, [Ibn al-'Awwam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-%27Awwam).[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Staub_2010-17)Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 14th century, and in Japan in the 18th century.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Simon_p._328-9)

#### Chemistry

[Polyacetylenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyyne) can be found in [Apiaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiaceae)vegetables like carrots where they show [cytotoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity)activities.[[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Zidorn_2005-23)[[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Baranska_2005-24) [Falcarinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcarinol) and [falcarindiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcarindiol) (*cis*-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)[[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Garrod_1978-25) are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards *Mycocentrospora acerina* and *Cladosporium cladosporioides*.[[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Garrod_1978-25) Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.[[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot#cite_note-Czepa_2003-26)
