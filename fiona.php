                <h3>Previous Work</h3>
                <p>I’ve worked in a variety of jobs in my hometown of Texas, such as at places like Soma Intimates Boutique
                    – a well known bra chain in the Woodlands mall – as a cashier in Sweet Tomatoes – a chain that associates
                    with Olive Garden – as well as Nothing Bundt Cakes – a smaller hometown cake store with very few chains
                    – and I’ve been working on and off at said jobs for the last few summers in Texas. I’m looking forward
                    to expanding this year to focus on an internships in the Rochester area so that way I can expand my knowledge
                    beyond what I currently have. I want to be able to complete a web-development based internship in the
                    Rochester area so that way I can begin to think about where I may want to work after graduation. I’ve
                    had a interest in web development due to my time in Introduction to Web Development (where I was able
                    to test out creating webpages for my course loads.</p>

                <h3>Current Work</h3>
                <p>I currently work as the Hartnett Gallery’s media manager, as well as previously as the media manager for
                    the Art Awake event that occurred on campus. I have worked as a media manager for both for the equivalent
                    about two years. I have worked on graphics for the Art Awake event, as well as worked on a variety of
                    graphics for several people who have asked in the past. I currently work as the art director for the
                    Underhill exhibit, in which I contact all the artists to create a collaborative piece in the next ten
                    days. I have also networked with both the Underhill Team and the Hartnett Team to create media for the
                    exhibit itself to make it displayable, as well as to make the event far more polished. I’ve been working
                    as the person to go to about any questions about artwork, as well as focusing on contacting people about
                    their individual pieces of art, as well as creating my own. I’ll be doing a collaboration with Margo
                    Slate that focuses on intertwining living and dying creatures, as well as my own individual piece that
                    features a woman who wears a crown of flowers, who is surrounded by dying imagery.</p>
