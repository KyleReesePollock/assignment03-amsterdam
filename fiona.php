                computer science with a focus in web development, studio arts with concentrations in digital art and photography,
                as well as a small cluster of linguistics based around analysis of meaning. I am currently living in The

            <h3>Experience</h3>

            <p>I’ve worked in a variety of jobs in my hometown of Texas, such as at places like Soma Intimates Boutique – a
                well known bra chain in the Woodlands mall – as a cashier in Sweet Tomatoes – a chain that associates with
                Olive Garden – as well as Nothing Bundt Cakes – a smaller hometown cake store with very few chains – and
                I’ve been working on and off at said jobs for the last few summers in Texas. I’m looking forward to expanding
                this year to focus on an internships in the Rochester area so that way I can expand my knowledge beyond what
                I currently have. I want to be able to complete a web-development based internship in the Rochester area
                so that way I can begin to think about where I may want to work after graduation. I’ve had a interest in
                web development due to my time in Introduction to Web Development (where I was able to test out creating
                webpages for my course loads.</p>


            <p>I currently work as the Hartnett Gallery’s media manager, as well as previously as the media manager for the
                Art Awake event that occurred on campus. I have worked as a media manager for both for the equivalent about
                two years. I have worked on graphics for the Art Awake event, as well as worked on a variety of graphics
                for several people who have asked in the past. I currently work as the art director for the Underhill exhibit,
                in which I contact all the artists to create a collaborative piece in the next ten days. I have also networked
                with both the Underhill Team and the Hartnett Team to create media for the exhibit itself to make it displayable,
                as well as to make the event far more polished. I’ve been working as the person to go to about any questions
                about artwork, as well as focusing on contacting people about their individual pieces of art, as well as
                creating my own. I’ll be doing a collaboration with Margo Slate that focuses on intertwining living and dying
                creatures, as well as my own individual piece that features a woman who wears a crown of flowers, who is
                surrounded by dying imagery.</p>
